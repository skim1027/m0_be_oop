# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

    *I was really overwhelmed at first. I didn't really grasp the idea of class, through reading the materials in Turing Mod 0 section. I had to do some additional research, watching multiple youtube videos to get a better understanding of class. I think I understand the basic concept, and it seems like my code works, so I hope that my understanding on how to set up your own class is accruate.*
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

    *I am getting better at stepping away when things are not working and stressing me out. I think I just need to make sure I don't take too long of a break*
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

    *That I am not going to understand something right away.. and that I do need to take some extra time to research, but I also need to learn to reach out to other classmates if things are not making sense and I need help even when I do additional research.*
